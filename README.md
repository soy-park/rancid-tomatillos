# Rancid Tomatillos

## Abstract
This web application was focused on creating a dashboard with easy to view and easy to navigate through various movies. It allows users to click on a single movie of their choice and see information pertaining to that movie. You can also search through our web app to find specific movies that match the users search criteria. This web application works with a local server and makes network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data. 

## Setup

In your forked GitHub repository, click the code drop-down menu and copy the SSH key. 
Open the terminal on your machine and navigate to the containing directory you’d like - to clone the repository folder and its contents to. On the command line, run “git clone” + the SSH key you copied earlier. A new folder will be created containing a local copy of the repository linked to the forked repository you created - enter the new directory.

Fork and clone this [repo](https://github.com/soy-park/rancid-tomatillos)

Install the library dependencies:
Run: ```npm install```

In the project directory, you can run:
Next: ```npm start``` in the terminal to see the HTML page

```Control + C``` is the command to stop running the local server

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view Rancid Tomatillos in your browser.

## Reflections: 
This project was completed during the second week of Module 3 at Turing School of Software and Design Front End Web Development program. Turing is a four module, seven month focused program on preparing students for a career as web developers working with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the React framework.
This is our first time working with React, Cypress Testing, and Routing. This project was completed over 10 days in line with the project specification and rubric detailed in this
[rubric](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/rancid-tomatillos-v3.html).
